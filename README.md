# github-release-notifier
This is a WIP (work in progress) repository, so expect several bugs to be present. Besides, I have to admit that this is mostly spaghetti code as of now.

What this executable does is it looks for the latest release of a repository, which will return back the name of it, and the date when it was released on. Though for later, I plan on adding a checker that will check for a new release of a repository in an interval of several minutes, which could be changed in settings.

# Compatibility
The program works on Python 3.6.0 and above. Python 2 isn't supported. Regarding the executable created using pyinstaller, I intended it to be x86, in order to maintain compatibility alongside x86 OS-es.
