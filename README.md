# github-release-notifier
This is a WIP (work in progress) repository, so expect several bugs to be present. Besides, I have to admit that this is mostly spaghetti code as of now.

One of the packages required is playsound for this script to work, though version 1.3.0 has issues regarding playing audio files, while version 1.2.2 didn't seem to raise any errors. There's a possiblity that I may switch to pygame for playing sound.

# Compatibility
The program works on Python 3.6.0 and above. Python 2 isn't supported. Regarding the executable compiled using pyinstaller, I intended it to be x86, in order to maintain compatibility alongside x86 OS-es.

Windows: Windows Vista and above

MacOS and Linux: not tested
