# github-release-notifier
This is a WIP (work in progress) repository, so expect several bugs to be present. Besides, I have to admit that this is mostly spaghetti code as of now.

Currently, I have issues with the playsound package, since 1.3.0 tends to crash when playing an audio file, but 1.2.2 worked fine.

# Compatibility
The program works on Python 3.6.0 and above. Python 2 isn't supported. Regarding the executable created using pyinstaller, I intended it to be x86, in order to maintain compatibility alongside x86 OS-es.

Windows: Windows Vista and above

MacOS and Linux: not tested
